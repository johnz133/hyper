/// A struct implementing a simple HTTP/2 client.
///
/// This client works as an HTTP/1.1 client with a Keep-Alive connection and
/// pipelining might work.
///
/// Multiple requests can be queued up (and sent to the server) by calling
/// `request` multiple times, before any `get_response`.
///
/// Once a `get_response` is issued, the client blocks until it receives the
/// response for the particular request that was referenced in the `get_response`
/// call.
///
/// Therefore, by doing `request` -> `get_response` we can use the HTTP/2
/// connection as a `Keep-Alive` HTTP/1.1 connection and a pipelined flow by
/// queuing up a sequence of requests and then "joining" over them by calling
/// `get_response` for each of them.
///
/// The responses that are returned by the client are very raw representations
/// of the response.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// - For now (temporarily) no requests with bodies are supported.
/// - For now, only HTTP/2 over a cleartext TCP connection is supported.
/// - A direct HTTP/2 connection is used (not an upgrade of an HTTP/1.1
///   connection)
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Issue a simple GET request using the helper `get` method.
///
/// ```no_run
/// use solicit::client::SimpleClient;
/// use std::str;
///
/// // Connect to an HTTP/2 aware server
/// let mut client = SimpleClient::connect("nghttp2.org", 80).ok().unwrap();
/// let response = client.get(b"/", &[]).ok().unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(response.stream_id, 1);
/// assert_eq!(response.status_code().ok().unwrap(), 200);
/// // Dump the headers and the response body to stdout.
/// // They are returned as raw bytes for the user to do as they please.
/// // (Note: in general directly decoding assuming a utf8 encoding might not
/// // always work -- this is meant as a simple example that shows that the
/// // response is well formed.)
/// for header in response.headers.iter() {
///     println!("{}: {}",
///         str::from_utf8(&header.0).unwrap(),
///         str::from_utf8(&header.1).unwrap());
/// }
/// println!("{}", str::from_utf8(&response.body).unwrap());
/// ```
